Questions from reason are ever present and cannot be answered.

Principle use is unavoidable and creates towers of thought as it reaches upward.
As we remove from experience, it is easy for contradictions to arise.

Logic is easy because it doesn't interact with objects.

Reason must have principles in order to gather anything from science. (Reflected in learning theory.)

Tendency of thought is to build and then check the foundations. Should be the reverse.

Clue that a judgement is made a priori: 1) Necessity (because experience only shows what something is, not that it must be) 2) Strict Universality

Bring many investigations into a single problem so that your own way is lightened and so that the judgement of others about your task can be more easily made.

Poor metaphysics :(
